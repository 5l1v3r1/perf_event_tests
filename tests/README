The Perf Event Testsuite
  by Vince Weaver   <vincent.weaver _at_ maine.edu>


This series of test is meant to validate that the perf_event
subsystem is working.

LAYOUT
~~~~~~
There are various subdirectories:

   + bugs      -- these contain tests for broken features of perf_events
                  that a tool like PAPI has to work around.

   + corner_cases -- these are tests that check unusual or uncommon
                  perf_event functionality.  They might not affect
                  common perf usage patterns but are still important
                  to get right

   + error_returns -- TODO

   + generalized_events -- tests that check the validity of the various
                  perf_event generalized events, such as "instructions"
                  or "cycles"

   + overflow  -- tests involving counter overflow functionality

   + record_sample -- tests that check the functionality of sample
                  recording

   + sysfs      -- test the parsing of various perf_event related
                   files under /sys/

   + unfinished -- TODO

   + validation -- tests that check low-level perf_event functionality

   + validation_privledged -- tests that are low-level but require
                   root or elevated permissions to run

   + unfinished -- unfinished tests
