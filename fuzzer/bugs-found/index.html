<h1><center><tt>perf_fuzzer</tt> perf_event syscall fuzzer</h1>

The <tt>perf_fuzzer</tt> tool automatically tests the 
perf_event_open() system call and attempts to find mostly-valid
inputs that potentially crash (or worse) the Linux kernel.
<br><br>

The code has already found numerous denial of service bugs and at
least one local root exploit.
<br><br>

I'm currently working on a paper describing how things work in more
detail.  I will post that when it is ready.
<br><br>

The <tt>perf_fuzzer</tt> is available as part of the
<a href="../validation/">perf_event_test</a> test suite.
<br><br>

Currently development is done via git at
<a href="https://github.com/deater/perf_event_tests">
https://github.com/deater/perf_event_tests</a>
; you can check out a version
of the development tree via:
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/deater/perf_event_tests
