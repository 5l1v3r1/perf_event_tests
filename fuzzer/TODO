Set breakpoint events on the mmap buffers?
Randomly mmap() existing events?
  - be sure to unmap once the event is destroyed

Forking -- make sure we clean up child threads?

Attaching to more pids (?)

For sysfs events, try also flipping a few random bits to try
to catch corner cases.

+ ->mmap2 support
+ double check why cpu is never set to -1?
