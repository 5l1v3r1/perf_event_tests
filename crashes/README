  out-of-memory your system with unfreeable kernel memory.

    changeset 38b435b16c36b0d863efcf3f07b34a6fac9873fd
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=38b435b16c36b0d863efcf3f07b34a6fac9873fd

+ pe_task_schedule_panic

  This tests the bug with task context scheduling that can
  cause a kernel panic or system hang.

  This problem was fixed in 2.6.39 and has been backported
  to the various stable kernels (2.6.38.4, etc.)

     changeset ab711fe08297de1485fff0a366e6db8828cafd6a
     http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=ab711fe08297de1485fff0a366e6db8828cafd6a


+ oflo_sw_cpu_clock_crash 

  Error with overflows and perf::perf_count_sw_cpu_clock and probably
  any software event.

  This test will either become unkillable, or else hard lock your system
  (maybe with a WARN_ON error) on Linux 2.6.32 - 3.0.0

  It was fixed in 3.1, a8b0ca17b80e92faab46ee7179ba9e99ccb61233
  and is gradually making its way into the stable trees.
