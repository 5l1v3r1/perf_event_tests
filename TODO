get perf cache-detection code going

inherit?
inherit and PERF_FORMAT_GROUP?


document:
  pinned flag?

perf tests:
+ All generalized events
+ More multi-threaded test cases
+ More assembler code in the cache load/stores tests

PAPI tests:
 + Invert flag
 + Max number of SW events


From Phil:
Do you guys have a test for:

a) grouped, non-multiplexed counters (where you can read/start/stop on one FD)
b) multiplexed, grouped counters
c) the portion of perf_events that uses counter indexing (returns a [5] array).
   (I'm not sure what this is useful for yet...sampling?)


Will Deacon:

If I try using perf with event groups on a mainline kernel, only the group
leader counts:


linaro@mashed-potato:~$ perf stat --no-scale -g -e task-clock -e cpu-clock -e cs
+-- ls
hwb  linux

 Performance counter stats for 'ls':

         17.545541 task-clock                #    0.634 CPUs utilized
          0.000000 cpu-clock
                 0 cs                        #    0.000 M/sec

       0.027684984 seconds time elapsed


This is fixed by b79387ef ("perf: Fix enable_on_exec for sibling events")
in -next (20111222) but I can't see this queued anywhere for 3.2 (I thought
I might see it in -rc7).

Is this going in for the final cut, or will groups just be borked until 3.3?

How can this be a regression? Its always been like that. At worst its a
broken new feature.

Also, you really shouldn't set enable_on_exec on non group leaders,
that's just daft. But yes that patch sorts it. Something like the below
should too.

+ test guest exclude support
  attr.exclude_{guest,host}
