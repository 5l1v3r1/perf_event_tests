The Perf Event Testsuite
  by Vince Weaver   <vweaver1 _at_ eecs.utk.edu>


This series of test is meant to validate that the perf_event
subsystem is working.


QUICKSTART
~~~~~~~~~~
  1. run "make"
  2. run "./run_tests.sh"

  If a test fails you can run the individual test to get more info on
  why.

LAYOUT
~~~~~~
There are various subdirectories:

   + bugs      -- these contain tests for broken features of perf_events
                  that a tool like PAPI has to work around.

   + crashes   -- these contain tests known to crash certain
                  kernel versions from userspace.
                  * USE CAUTION RUNNING THESE TESTS *

   + validation -- tests that validate the perf_event generalized
                  events to see if they count what we think they do

   + unfinished -- unfinished tests
