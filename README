The Perf Event Testsuite
  by Vince Weaver   <vweaver1 _at_ eecs.utk.edu>


This series of test is meant to validate that the perf_event
subsystem is working.

There are various subdirectories:

   + bugs      -- these contain tests for broken features of perf_events
                  that a tool like PAPI has to work around.

   + crashes   -- these contain tests known to crash certain
                  kernel versions from userspace.
                  * USE CAUTION RUNNING THESE TESTS *

   + validation -- tests that validate the perf_event generalized
                  events to see if they count what we think they do

   + unfinished -- unfinished tests

To run the tests, in general just enter the directory, run "make"
  then run "./run_tests.sh".  You can also run the individual tests of 
  interest for more results.
