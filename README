The Perf Event Testsuite
  by Vince Weaver   <vincent.weaver _at_ maine.edu>


This series of test is meant to validate that the perf_event
subsystem is working.


QUICKSTART
~~~~~~~~~~
  1. run "make"
  2. run "./run_tests.sh"

  If a test fails you can run the individual test to get more info on
  why.


LAYOUT
~~~~~~
There are various subdirectories:

   + bugs      -- these contain tests for broken features of perf_events
                  that a tool like PAPI has to work around.

   + corner_cases -- these are tests that check unusual or uncommon
                  perf_event functionality.  They might not affect
                  common perf usage patterns but are still important
                  to get right

   + crashes   -- these contain tests known to crash certain
                  kernel versions from userspace.
                  * USE CAUTION RUNNING THESE TESTS *

   + generalized_events -- tests that check the validity of the various
                  perf_event generalized events, such as "instructions"
                  or "cycles"

   + overflow  -- tests involving counter overflow functionality

   + papi       -- tests for the PAPI library.  Only compile/run
                  these if you have PAPI installed

   + record_sample -- tests that check the functionality of sample
                  recording

   + validation -- tests that check low-level perf_event functionality

   + validation_privledged -- tests that are low-level but require
                   root or elevated permissions to run

   + unfinished -- unfinished tests
