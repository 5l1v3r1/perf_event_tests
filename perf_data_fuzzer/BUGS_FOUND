#0 -- calling perf via execve() with argv[0]==NULL causes segfault
	this technically isn't really a bug, just annoying

#1 -- f_header.attr_size ==0 causes a floating point exception
	patch sent

#2 -- perf_header__read_build_ids gets filename size from the
	perf.data file and copies it to a 4096 buffer w/o
	checking it is too big.  Despite being a buffer smash,
	various Linux protections make this hard to exploit.

#3 -- perf_header pmu parsing.  If a string is marked as size 0,
	malloc will happily allocate space but any string ops
	trying to operate on it will have problems with that.
